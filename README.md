# Implementation-of-Searching-Algorithms
Used python to implement 3 searching algorithms - Brute-force, Knuth–Morris–Pratt, and Rabin-Karp for our Algorithms project. A GUI was also done to make the searching process easier for the user - the user can choose the file they want to search to upload (maximum size around 3.2GB), then enter the text they would like to search, and finally choose the searching algorithm they want to use. Some input files we used to test the code/application are included, all in .fna format.
A report on our code/application is also included.
